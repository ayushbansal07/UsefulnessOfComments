Instructions to run:
1.  Place the code for which we have to run in codes/ folder.
      Eg. We want to run the code for codes/friend_class.cpp
2.  Create a file with same codename and extention as .lines which containes a "SPACE SEPARATED" list of line numbers for which we need a feedback button.
    PLEASE NOTE that the file should not contain any trailing spaces/new line character.
      Eg. Create a file codes/friend_class.lines
3.  Now, run the instruction
    python codes_to_html.py <path to code>.
      Eg. run python codes_to_html.py codes/friend_class.cpp

Output - Inside codes_output, an html file named <code_file_name>.html would be there (Eg. codes_output/friend_class.html).
         Copy that file to webapp folder (because it contains the JS and CSS) and open html in the browser.

Required files to run -
1. codes_to_html.py
2. pre_html.txt
3. post_html.txt
4. Code file
5. Lines file
